/**
 * Build covered indexes for phoenix updates.
 * <p>
 * Before any call to prePut/preDelete, the row has already been locked. This ensures that we don't
 * need to do any extra synchronization in the IndexBuilder.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This builder does not correctly support adding the same row twice to a batch
 * update. For instance, adding a {@link Put} of the same row twice with different values at
 * different timestamps. In this case, the {@link TableState} will return the state of the table
 * before the batch; the second Put would <i>not</i> see the earlier Put applied. The reason for
 * this is that it is very hard to manage invalidating the local table state in case of failure and
 * maintaining a row cache across a batch (see {@link LocalTable} for more information on why). The
 * current implementation would manage the above case by possibly not realizing it needed to issue a
 * cleanup delete for the index row, leading to an invalid index as one of the updates wouldn't be
 * properly covered by a delete.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This implementation doesn't cleanup the index when we remove a key-value on compaction or
 * flush, leading to a bloated index that needs to be cleaned up by a background process.
