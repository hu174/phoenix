   * is because it doesn't make sense to build index updates when there is no change in the table
   * state for any of the columns you are indexing.

   * need to track the indexed columns.

   * As a side-effect, we update a timestamp for the next-most-recent timestamp for the columns you
   * request - you will never see a column with the timestamp we are tracking, but the next oldest
   * timestamp for that column.
   * <p>
   * If you are always guaranteed to get the most recent update on the index columns for the primary
   * table row (e.g. the client is not setting custom timestamps, but instead relying on the server
   * to set them), then you don't need to use this method and can instead just use
